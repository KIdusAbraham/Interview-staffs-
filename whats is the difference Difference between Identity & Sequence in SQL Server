Whats are the differences between Identity & Sequence in SQL Server?

    Difference 1:
      The IDENTITY property is tied to a particular table and cannot be shared among multiple tables since it is a table column property.
      On the flip side the SEQUENCE object is defined by the user and can be shared by multiple tables since is it is not tied to any table.
 
 Difference 2:
    To generate the next IDENTITY value, a new row has to be inserted into the table. On the other hand, the next VALUE for a 
    SEQUENCE object can simply be generated using the NEXT VALUE FOR clause with the sequence object.
 
 Difference 3
    The value for the IDENTITY property cannot be reset to its initial value. In contrast, the value for the SEQUENCE object can be reset.

          CREATE SEQUENCE [dbo].[RecycleSequence]
           AS INT
           START WITH 1
           INCREMENT BY 1
           MINVALUE 1
           MAXVALUE 3
           CYCLE
           
 Difference 4
      A maximum value cannot be set for the IDENTITY property. On the other hand, the maximum value for a SEQUENCE object can be defined.

      For a SEQUENCE object the MAXVALUE clause can be used to set the maximum value as shown in the following example.

            CREATE SEQUENCE [dbo].[MaxSequence]
             AS INT
             START WITH 1
             INCREMENT BY 1
             MAXVALUE 3
    In the above script, a SEQUENCE object has been created with a maximum value of 3. If you increment the value of this SEQUENCE 
    beyond 3, it will throw an  error.
