RE-DESIGNING OF THE DATABASE AND TABLES 

    1. while designing the database and the table I modified the table so that ROW OVERFLOW DATA is avoided 
    
      most of the tables had more that 30 columns and the size of the row/column was very large
      I normalized the table so that large colums are stored in a different table 
      I make a foreign key relationships between the tables 
      
      
      Since performance was impacted by row overlow, after redesigning and normalizing the tables, the performance was improved 
      
    1. Page density: the munber of rows in a page. the lower the density the lower the performance. 
        having in appropraite varchar(max) in a table will hit the performance
