By default deadlock is not logged in the error or event log. If you want to capture this information in the SQL 
Server Error Log you need to enable one or both of these trace flags.
    
    1204 - this provides information about the nodes involved in the deadlock
    1222 - returns deadlock information in an XML format
To turn these trace on the startup, we need to run the following DBCC statements.
    DBCC (1204, -1)
    DBCC (1222, -1)
