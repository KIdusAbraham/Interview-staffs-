whats normalization, ER  diagram, and cardinality?

Normalization
    Database Normalization is a technique of organizing the data in the database. 
    Normalization is a systematic approach of decomposing tables to eliminate data redundancy(repetition) 
    and undesirable characteristics like Insertion, Update and Deletion Anomalies. It is a multi-step process 
    that puts data into tabular form, removing duplicated data from the relation tables.
    Normalization is used for mainly two purposes,
        Eliminating redundant(useless) data.
        Ensuring data dependencies make sense i.e data is logically stored.

Cardinality 


ER diagram
    An Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) is a snapshot of data structures. An Entity Relationship Diagram shows entities 
    (tables) in a database and relationships between tables within that database. 
    For a good database design it is essential to have an Entity Relationship Diagram.
