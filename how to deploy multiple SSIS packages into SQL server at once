how to deploy multiple SSIS packages into SQL server at once?
  
  There are several ways to accoplish this
  1. Using Command Prompt Utility â€“ DTUTIL
      this tool is found in the Binn folder of SQL Server (For eg: C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\110\DTS\Binn\dtutil.exe)
       (https://dataginger.com/2013/10/02/sql-server-how-to-copy-or-export-an-ssis-package-using-command-prompt-utility-dtutil/)
  2. using stored procedure 
  
      DECLARE @ProjectBinary as varbinary(max)  
      DECLARE @operation_id as bigint  
      Set @ProjectBinary = (SELECT * FROM OPENROWSET(BULK 'C:\MyProjects\ SSISPackage_ProjectDeployment.ispac', 
      SINGLE_BLOB) as BinaryData)  

      Exec catalog.deploy_project @folder_name = 'SSIS Packages', @project_name = 'DeployViaStoredProc_SSIS', 
      @Project_Stream = @ProjectBinary, @operation_id = @operation_id out  

  
  3. using SSIS package itself 
  
  
  4. By using powershell
