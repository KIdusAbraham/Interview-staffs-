CAST and CONVERT are both used to convert data from one data type to another.

The differences are 
    1) syntax 
      CAST (ColumnName AS NewDataType)
      VONVERT (NewDatatype, ColumnName)
   2) CAST is part of the ANSI-SQL specification; whereas, CONVERT is not.  In fact, CONVERT is SQL implementation specific.
   3) CONVERT differences lie in that it accepts an optional style parameter which is used for formatting.
