what is sql server stretch database?

Problem
You need to keep all of your data online in the event that you need to access the data. But some of this data is warm data 
(needed frequently) and other is cold data (needed occasionally). 
In this tip we look at how we can achieve this using the new stretch database feature in SQL Server and Azure.

Solution
SQL Server 2016 introduced the Stretch Database option to migrate your cold data transparently and securely to the Microsoft Azure cloud. 
To use this feature, you must have access to a Microsoft Azure subscription and permissions to be able to communicate with Azure.
